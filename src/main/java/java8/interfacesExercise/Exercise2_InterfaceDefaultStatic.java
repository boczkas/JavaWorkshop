    // 1.   Create interface with log(String toBePrinted) method.
    //      Create class which implements this interface
    //      Create implementation of log(String toBePrinted) in class - it should print provided string
    //      Create object of class and call log()
    //      Run to see what is printed
    //
    // 2.   Change method in interface to default
    //      Provide implementation in interface - it should also print provided string, but with some indication
    //                                            that print comes from interface's method
    //      Run to see what is printed
    //
    // 3.   Create second interface with default implementation of log(String toBePrinted) method
    //      Create new class which is implementing both interfacesExercise
    //      Are there any problems? If something is not working fix it, without any change in interfacesExercise
    //
    // 4.   Create default toString() in interface. Is it possible? If it is not, why?
    //
    // 5.   Change default to static in first interface.
    //      What have happened and why?
    //      When static implementations might be helpful
